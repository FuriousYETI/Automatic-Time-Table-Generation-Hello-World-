## User Manual for Time-table Automation System

### 1. Overview

The Time-table Automation System is a command-line Python application designed to automate the scheduling of courses for academic sessions at a university. It processes course data, assigns rooms, schedules lectures, tutorials, and labs while avoiding conflicts (e.g., professor and room conflicts), and accounts for break times (morning and lunch breaks). The system generates timetables for each department-semester combination and outputs them to an Excel file (timetable_all_departments.xlsx). It also identifies and reports unscheduled courses in unscheduled_courses.xlsx and generates faculty schedules in all_faculty_timetables.xlsx.

This manual provides instructions for downloading, setting up, and using the system, along with usage scenarios, requirements satisfied, future work, and FAQs.

### 3. How to Set Up the Software

#### Prerequisites

- *Python 3.9 or later*: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- *Git*: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional, for cloning).
- *pip*: Python's package manager (included with Python).

#### Setup Steps

1. *Navigate to the Project Directory*:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:
  
  cd timetable-automation
  

2. *Create a Virtual Environment*:

- Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
  
  python -m venv venv
  
- Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
  - On macOS/Linux:
    
    source venv/bin/activate
    

3. *Install Dependencies*:

- The system requires the following Python libraries:
  - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - openpyxl: Reading/writing Excel files
  - datetime: Date and time manipulation
  - random: Random number generation
  - csv: CSV file reading/writing
  - json: JSON data manipulation
  - os: Operating system interfaces
  - traceback: Stack trace extraction for error reporting
  - dataclasses: declare data containers 

- Install the main dependencies using:
  
  pip install pandas openpyxl
  
- The other packages (datetime, random, collections, csv, json, os, traceback) are part of Python's standard library and don't need separate installation.

- Alternatively, if a requirements.txt file is provided, run:
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  

4. *Place Configuration Files*:

- Ensure the required input files (combined.csv and rooms.csv) are in the project directory (see Section 4 for details).

5. *Run the Application*:

- Run the script to generate timetables:
  
  python TT_gen.py
  
- The script will generate:
  - timetable_all_departments.xlsx - The main timetable file with all department schedules
  - unscheduled_courses.xlsx - Report of courses that couldn't be fully scheduled
  - teacher_timetables.xlsx - Individual schedules for all faculty members
  - Exam_timetable.xlsx - The exam timetable for Jan-April session

### 5. Usage Scenarios

Since the system is a command-line application, usage involves running the script and viewing the output Excel files.

#### Scenario 1: Generate Timetables for All Departments and Semesters

1. *Prepare Input Files*:

- Ensure combined.csv and rooms.csv are in the project directory with the correct data.
- *Screenshot Placeholder*: [Insert screenshot of the project directory with the input files]

2. *Run the Script*:

- Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:
  
  python TT_gen.py
  
- The script will:
  - Read course and room data.
  - Schedule lectures, tutorials, and labs while avoiding conflicts.
  - Allocate break times (morning break: 10:30-10:45; lunch break: dynamically staggered between 12:30-14:00).
  - Generate timetable_all_departments.xlsx with separate sheets for each department-semester combination (e.g., CSE_5, ECE_3).
- *Screenshot Placeholder*: [Insert screenshot of the terminal showing the script execution and completion message]

3. *View the Timetable*:

- Open timetable_all_departments.xlsx in Excel.

- Each department-semester sheet shows a timetable with:
  - Days (Monday to Friday) as rows.
  - Time slots (9:00 to 18:30, in 30-minute intervals) as columns.
  - Course details (code, type, faculty, room) in each slot.
  - A legend at the bottom listing courses, faculty, and LTPS details.
  - Self-study only courses and unscheduled components (if any).
- *Screenshot Placeholder*: [Insert screenshot of a timetable sheet in timetable_all_departments.xlsx]

4. *Check for Unscheduled Courses*:

### 6. Requirements Satisfied by the Current Version

The current version satisfies the following requirements:

- *REQ-02-Config*: The system reads course data and room assignments from combined.csv and rooms.csv.
- *REQ-03*: Courses are scheduled in classrooms with sufficient capacity, with students split into sections if needed.
- *REQ-04-CONFLICTS*: The system distributes course components over the week and avoids scheduling multiple components on the same day.
- *REQ-05*: Courses with the same code from different departments are scheduled separately.
- *REQ-06*: Scheduling adheres to the LTPS structure (e.g., 1.5 hours lecture = 3 slots, 2 hours lab = 4 slots, 1 hour tutorial = 2 slots).
- *REQ-07*: Elective courses are grouped into baskets (B1, B2, etc.) and scheduled to avoid conflicts.
- *REQ-08*: Lab sessions are allocated based on lab room capacity, with multiple batches if needed.
- *REQ-09-BREAKS*: Morning break (15 minutes) and inter-class breaks (5 minutes) are included in the schedule.
- *REQ-10-FACULTY*: The system tries to maintain at least 3 hours between a faculty member's classes on the same day.
- *REQ-14-VIEW*: Timetables are exported to Excel for viewing by coordinators, faculty, and students.
- *REQ-18-LUNCH*: Lunch breaks are scheduled in a staggered fashion to avoid overcrowding.

### 8. FAQs

*Q: What should I do if the script fails to run?*

- A: Ensure combined.csv and rooms.csv are in the project directory with the correct format. Check that all dependencies (pandas, openpyxl) are installed. Review the terminal error message for details.

*Q: What if some courses are unscheduled?*

- A: The script generates unscheduled_courses.xlsx with details of unscheduled courses. You can adjust the input data (e.g., reduce conflicts, add more rooms) and rerun the script.

*Q: Can I customize the time slots or break times?*

- A: Yes, but you'll need to modify the constants in the code (START_TIME, END_TIME, LECTURE_DURATION, etc.). A future version will include a configuration file for these settings.

*Q: How do I view the timetable for a specific department?*

- A: Open timetable_all_departments.xlsx in Excel. The "Overview" sheet contains links to each department-semester timetable.

*Q: How can a faculty member view their schedule?*

- A: Open all_faculty_timetables.xlsx in Excel. The "Overview" sheet contains links to each faculty member's schedule.

*Q: How does the system handle basket courses (electives)?*

- A: Basket courses (e.g., B1, B2) are scheduled in parallel time slots to avoid conflicts for students who need to choose one course from each basket.

*Q: What happens if a room type is missing in rooms.csv?*

- A: The script will print a warning (e.g., "No LECTURE_ROOM type rooms found") and try to continue with available rooms. Ensure all required room types are included in rooms.csv.

*Q: How do I add more faculty or courses?*

- A: Simply add new entries to the combined.csv file following the same format as existing entries.
