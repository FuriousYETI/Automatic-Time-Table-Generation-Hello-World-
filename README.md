# Automated Time-Table Scheduling for IIIT Dharwad
# Introduction

- Creating and maintaining academic timetables at IIIT Dharwad is a complex and time-consuming task. The existing manual, slot-based system using spreadsheets or PDFs is rigid, error-prone, and inefficient.

- This project automates timetable generation using intelligent scheduling algorithms to produce optimized, conflict-free, and dynamic timetables. The system supports integration with Google Calendar, and can be extended to handle exam scheduling and seating arrangements.
  
# Objectives

- Generate conflict-free and optimized timetables while adhering to academic and administrative constraints.

- Provide real-time updates and cross-platform accessibility.

- Integrate with Google Calendar for synchronization and reminders.

- Support rescheduling during faculty absence, holidays, or weather disruptions.

- Extend functionality to exam timetable generation and seating arrangements.
