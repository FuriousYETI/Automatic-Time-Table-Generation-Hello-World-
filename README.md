## Automated Time-Table Scheduling for IIIT Dharwad
# Introduction

Creating and maintaining a timetable at IIIT Dharwad is a complex scheduling task. The existing manual, slot-based method using spreadsheets or PDFs is rigid, error-prone, and time-consuming.

This project aims to automate timetable generation using intelligent scheduling algorithms to ensure optimized, conflict-free, and dynamic timetables. The system will also integrate with Google Calendar and support additional modules such as exam scheduling and seating arrangements.

## Objectives

Generate conflict-free and optimized timetables while respecting academic and administrative constraints.

Provide real-time updates and cross-platform accessibility.

Integrate with Google Calendar for synchronization and reminders.

Support rescheduling during faculty absence, holidays, or weather disruptions.

Extend functionality to exam timetable generation and seating arrangements.
