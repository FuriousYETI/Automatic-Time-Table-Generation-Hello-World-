Automated Time-Table Scheduling for IIIT Dharwad

Introduction
Creating and maintaining a timetable at IIIT Dharwad is a complex scheduling task. The manual slot-based method using spreadsheets or PDFs is rigid, error-prone, and time-consuming.
This project aims to automate timetable generation using intelligent scheduling algorithms, ensuring optimized, conflict-free, and dynamic timetables. The system will also integrate with modern tools like Google Calendar and support features such as exam scheduling and seating arrangements.

Objectives
Generate conflict-free, optimized timetables respecting academic and administrative constraints.
Provide real-time updates and cross-platform access.
Integrate with Google Calendar for reminders and synchronization.
Support rescheduling during faculty absence, holidays, or weather disruptions.
Extend functionality to exam timetable generation and seating arrangements.

Features
Availability Tracking: Professors, classrooms, labs, and students.
Input Support: Course code, name, LTPSC structure, instructor, semester, etc.

Rules Enforced:
One lecture per course per day.
Fixed lunch and refresh breaks.
Minimum 3-hour gap between classes for faculty.
Labs scheduled on the same day as lectures.
Dynamic Rescheduling: Handles half-semester vs full-semester clashes.
Color-Coded Timetable: Core courses (green), Labs (blue), Electives (orange).

Exam Module: Generates conflict-free exam schedules, seating charts, invigilator duty lists, and hall tickets.
